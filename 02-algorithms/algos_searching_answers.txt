1. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many
iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?
-Linearly, it would take seven iterations to find G.

2. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many
iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?
- With a binary search, it would take three iterations, as it did to find
E in the example.

3. Calculate fib(10), fib(11), fib(12) by hand.
fib(10) == 55
fib(11) == 89
fib(12) == 144

Benchmark output for real time in iterative search for fib(20) = (  0.000015)
Benchmark output for real time in recursive search for fib(20) = (  0.001921)

1. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you
choose between linear search and binary search? Would you use an iterative or
recursive solution? Explain your reasoning.
-If the collection was unsorted, I would use an iterative search as a binary
search only works with sorted collections. Based on the Benchmark speeds that
I got comparing iterative and recursive searches, I'd have to also go with an
iterative linear search.

2. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you
choose between linear search and binary search? Would you use an iterative or
recursive solution? Explain your reasoning.
-If the collection was sorted, I would use a binary search, since less iterations
would be needed to complete the search with this method. Again, I would use an
iterative solution as it appears to be faster.
