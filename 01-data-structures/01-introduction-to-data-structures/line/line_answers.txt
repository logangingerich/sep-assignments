How does your data structure allow developers to access and
manipulate the data?
-Developers can access and manipulate through several methods
built into the line class. They can add members via the join method
and remove members via the leave method. They can find which member is
in the front, back or middle with the front, middle and back methods.
They can also perform a search for a particular member with the search
method.

If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data
structure, how would you search for it?
-The search method would allow the developer to pass in a name
and see whether or not that person is in the line. They can also
find any member's position in the line, or index number, by passing
the name into the index method.

What other real-world data can each structure represent?
This data structure could also be used for something like a
waiting list for a college class.
