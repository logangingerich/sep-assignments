How does your data structure allow developers to access and
manipulate the data?
-A developer could initialize an instance of a pixel using the
Pixel class and passing in RGB colors and an xy matrix location.
They can also initialize a pixel matrix in the Screen class by
passing in width and height. They can then add an instance of a
pixel to the matrix by using the insert method and passing it the
pixel and height/width.

If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data
structure, how would you search for it?
-A developer could find what specific pixel is at a particular
matrix coordinate by using the 'at' method and passing in
height and width values.

What other real-world data can each structure represent?
-This data structure could be useful in representing any type
of simple matrix of information. You could also use it for simple data
encryption or a game such as Battleship.
