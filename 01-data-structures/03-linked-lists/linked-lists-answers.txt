What is Spatial Locality and why does it benefit performance?
-Spatial Locality is the concept that the likelihood of referencing a particular
resource is higher if a resource near it was just referenced. So, when the
processor retrieves data from RAM and adds it to the Cache, it retrieves an
entire range of locations, not just a single location.
This benefits performance by reducing the number of times the computer must read
from RAM.

Compare the time it takes to create a 10,000 item Array to appending 10,000
items to a Linked List.

Array creation test
0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.002212)
Linked List creation test
0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.003632)

The array creation appears to be slightly faster.

Compare the time it takes to access the 5000th element of the Array and the
5000th Node in the Linked List.

Array access item 5,000 test
0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000036)
Linked List access item 5,000 test
0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000438)

Accessing the 5,000th item in the array is much faster, presumably because it
doesn't require iterating over every previous item.

Compare the time it takes to remove the 5000th element from the Array to
removing the 5000th Node in the Linked List.

Array delete item 5,000 test
0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000019)
Linked List delete item 5,000 test
0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000387)

Again, deleting the 5000th element from the Array appears to be faster, as it
doesn't require iterating over every item previous to the 5,000th.
